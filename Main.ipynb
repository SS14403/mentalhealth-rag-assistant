      "Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a complex mental disorder characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, along with marked impulsivity. This pattern typically begins by early adulthood and is present across various contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Diagnostic Criteria:**\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the DSM-5, an individual must exhibit five or more of the following criteria to be diagnosed with BPD:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment:** These efforts may include impulsive actions such as self-harm or suicidal behaviors.\n",
      "2.  **A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships:** Characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation.\n",
      "3.  **Identity disturbance:** Markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self.\n",
      "4.  **Impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging:** Such as spending, sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, or binge eating.\n",
      "5.  **Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or self-mutilating behavior.**\n",
      "6.  **Affective instability:** Due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability, or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days).\n",
      "7.  **Chronic feelings of emptiness.**\n",
      "8.  **Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger:** For example, frequent displays of temper, constant anger, or recurrent physical fights.\n",
      "9.  **Transient, stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Individuals with BPD may undermine themselves when a goal is about to be realized.\n",
      "*   They may experience psychotic-like symptoms during times of stress.\n",
      "*   They might feel more secure with transitional objects than in interpersonal relationships.\n",
      "*   Premature death from suicide can occur, especially with co-occurring disorders.\n",
      "*   Recurrent job losses, interrupted education, and separation or divorce are common.\n",
      "*   Histories of physical or sexual abuse, neglect, hostile conflict, and early parental loss are more common in those with BPD.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Prevalence:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   The median population prevalence is estimated to be 1.6%, but it may be as high as 5.9%.\n",
      "*   Prevalence is about 6% in primary care settings, 10% in outpatient mental health clinics, and 20% among psychiatric inpatients.\n",
      "*   The prevalence may decrease in older age groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Development and Course:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   The most common pattern is chronic instability in early adulthood, with episodes of serious affective and impulsive dyscontrol.\n",
      "*   Impairment and suicide risk are greatest in young adulthood and gradually wane with age.\n",
      "*   Therapeutic intervention often leads to improvement within the first year.\n",
      "*   Many individuals attain greater stability in relationships and vocational functioning during their 30s and 40s.\n",
      "*   After about 10 years, as many as half of the individuals no longer meet full criteria for BPD.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Risk and Prognostic Factors:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   BPD is about five times more common among first-degree biological relatives of those with the disorder.\n",
      "*   There is also an increased familial risk for substance use disorders, antisocial personality disorder, and depressive or bipolar disorders.\n",
